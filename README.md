# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abhay Agarwal, a passionate beginner in web development with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
I am a dedicated learner who is enthusiastic about creating beautiful and interactive web applications. My journey in web development began with HTML and CSS, where I honed my skills in creating well-structured and visually appealing web pages. As I delved deeper into the world of front-end development, I discovered the power of JavaScript, allowing me to add dynamic and interactive elements to my projects.

Currently, I'm particularly excited about React.js. Its component-based architecture and virtual DOM make building complex user interfaces a breeze. I enjoy exploring the vast React ecosystem and staying up-to-date with the latest libraries and frameworks.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- **Tour and Travel Website:** My project is a tour and travel website built using React.js and Sass, providing users with an interactive and visually appealing experience to explore and book tours.
- **ToDo App:** My project is a Todo App built using React.js that enables users to manage tasks, including adding, editing, and marking tasks as complete.
- **E-commerce website :** My project is an e-commerce website developed using React.js, allowing users to browse and purchase a wide range of products in a user-friendly interface.

Feel free to explore my repositories for more projects and code snippets!

## Learning Goals
As a beginner, my primary goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in web development. Some areas I'm currently focusing on include:

- Deepening my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including ES6 features and advanced concepts.
- Exploring more advanced topics in React.js, such as Redux, context API, and React hooks.
- Improving my proficiency in responsive web design and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.
